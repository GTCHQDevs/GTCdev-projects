      <h2 class="name">Kingsford Bloomfield</h2>
      <div>
          <p class="bio-info">
          Bishop Kingsford A. Bloomfield, born in Passage Fort, St. Catherine, Jamaica, accepted the Lord at the tender age of nine and a half while attending The Rehoboth Apostolic Church. After witnessing his friendâ€™s decision to accept Christ, he too, decided to follow the same path that very night. He went on to graduate from St. Jago High School and the University of the West Indies at Mona. As a young minister, he served under the leadership of Bishop B.S.E. Dyer primarily as a musician and a Sunday School teacher while ardently supporting the ministry in various other areas.

          </p>
          <p class="bio-info">
            After migrating to the United States, he faithfully served under our late founder, Bishop Samuel Green II at the Headquarters church as an Elder, Musician, and Bible Teacher, among various other duties. In 1997 he was sent to the Franklin Ave branch and served as the Pastor there for seven years. Bishop, Mother Bloomfield and the saints there experienced a tremendous transformation and growth of the ministry there. While at the Franklin Ave branch, he was consecrated as an Overseer. After the death of our Founding Bishop in November 2003, he returned to pastor the Headquarters church in 2004. Subsequently in October 2006, he was consecrated as the Presiding Bishop of the Gospel Tabernacle churches. He currently serves in this capacity overseeing the 11 branches within the organization.

          </p>
          <p class="bio-info">
            His wife of almost 45 years, Mother Janette Bloomfield, a powerful and committed woman of God is his biggest supporter who is in constant prayer and intercession on his behalf. They both have worked in ministry for most of their lives and continue to be steadfast in their dedication to serving the people of God. Together were blessed by the Lord with three children, Kijan, Kajette, and Kingsford II as well as many adopted and spiritual children. Bishop Bloomfield is fully surrendered to the call of God on his life and trusts God explicitly for direction. He often can be heard encouraging the saints to exercise their faith in God without reservation, this he believes will allow us to truly experience all God has for us individually and as a church family.
