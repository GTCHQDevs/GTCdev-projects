Elder Owen Wattson was born in Saint Elizabeth, Jamaica. He gave his life to the Lord in 1998 at the age of 25 after being drawn deeper into the Apostolic faith. His walk with Christ has been shaped by the examples of others, a love for learning, and a desire to grow through both encouragement and correction.
He currently serves as an Elder at Gospel Tabernacle Church, where he leads the Men’s Department, teaches Sunday School, and assists with baptisms. Elder Wattson believes God has called him to preach, teach, and live a life that draws others to Christ.
He is supported in ministry by his wife, a prayerful partner in faith, and together they are raising their daughter Victoria to know and love the Lord by example—both at home and in the church. Outside of ministry, Elder Wattson works as a laborer at City College
